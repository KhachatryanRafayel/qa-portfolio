_It is also important to mention, that the name of the e-commerce platform is omitted to keep the testing case generic and avoid referencing a specific product._

_This testing was conducted without formal requirements; reported issues are based on tester assumptions and are included to demonstrate understanding of testing techniques rather than to represent confirmed defects._

_This work is intended solely as a portfolio example and does not reflect the actual quality or state of any specific production system._
