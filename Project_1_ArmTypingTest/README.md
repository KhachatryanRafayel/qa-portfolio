# Testing of the "ArmTypingTest" Game

A simple typing speed trainer game developed on Python and Pygame. You can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/KhachatryanRafayel/ArmTypingTest).

My goal was to test it as an end-user and find possible bugs.
## What was done:

1.  **Check-lists** — created a list of all features to test.
2.  **Test-cases** — wrote detailed test scenarios based on the check-lists. Found **7 bugs** during execution.
3.  **Bug-reports** — documented all found issues.
4.  **Summary Report** — compiled the final testing report.
