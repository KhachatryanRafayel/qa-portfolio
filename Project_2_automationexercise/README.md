# Testing of the "[automationexercise](https://automationexercise.com/)" Website

A live website where I performed exploratory testing to find functional and UI/UX issues.

My goal was to examine the site from a user's perspective and identify any bugs affecting the experience.
## What was done:

1. **Exploratory Testing** — thoroughly tested key user flows and functionalities.
2. **Bug Reporting** — found and documented **12 bugs** with detailed steps to reproduce. *All bugs were also logged in Jira; I can provide access to the project upon request.*
3. **Summary Report** — compiled the final testing report with results and statistics.

- [Summary Report](https://github.com/KhachatryanRafayel/qa-portfolio/blob/main/Project_2_automationexercise/Summary%20Report.md)

Also i want to note, that although this website is designed for automation practice, it is also a valuable target for manual exploratory testing to uncover UI/UX and functional bugs.

*The original bug reports are also available in Jira. Feel free to contact me if you'd like to review them in the project.*
